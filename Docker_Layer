Docker Layers:

1. Base Image Layer
   The first layer of a Docker image is often the base OS layer (e.g., ubuntu, alpine, etc.). This layer includes the operating system and is the foundation upon which additional layers are built.
2. Internidiate Layer
   Each subsequent layer represents an instruction in the Dockerfile. For example, running a RUN command to install software packages creates a new layer on top of the base image.
   Layers are read-only. Once a layer is created, it cannot be changed. If you change an instruction in the Dockerfile and rebuild the image, Docker creates a new layer for that instruction.
3. writable container Layer
   When a container is launched from an image, Docker uses a union filesystem to stack all read-only image layers and then adds a writable layer on top. This topmost layer is where all changes are made during the container's runtime. If files from the read-only layers are modified or deleted, the changes are reflected in this writable layer.
